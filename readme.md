# Memory Card Game

This webpage was developed for the Milestone 2, where I have developed a memory card game based on the Zelda game franchise. The page was made to create a fun and simple experience for the player. The game has a scoring system and turn counter for competitiveness. The webpage was developed with mobile first design, then for larger screens to ensure responsiveness.
